# dos-vmm

Writing an 16-bit x86 real mode hypervisor/VMM from scratch to run MS-DOS. Yes, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

Idea kicked off by the recent release of the [MS-DOS source code](https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS) by Microsoft, and by me stumbling onto a blog post on [Building a hypervisor, 1: KVM Introduction](https://iovec.net/2024-01-29).
